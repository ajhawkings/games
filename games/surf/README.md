I did not create this game; I just copied the files from Microsoft Edge and modified some URLs so it would work outside of Edge.

## Playing
Play the game at https://surf.jackbuehner.com

## What is changed
- Changed some URLs
- Added a favicon
- Added an ico favicon to support multiple icon sizes
- Added a manifest.json so the website can be added as a PWA app
- Ran minimized JavaScript files through a beautifier to make modification easier.
- Updated functions in surf.bundle.js which relied on [WebUI](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/webui_explainer.md) and called into native code on Edge. Those functions now use localStorage to save the game stats.

If you know how to fix anything that is not working, feel free to open a pull request. I'll merge it as soon as I see it and confirm it does not break anything.
